# **SyncApp: Cross-Platform File & Clipboard Sync**

SyncApp enables seamless synchronization of files and clipboard content between your desktop (Windows/Linux) and mobile device without requiring an internet connection. The desktop app (Python Tkinter) and mobile app (Flutter) communicate directly over a local hotspot, using QR codes for secure, instant pairing.

- Effortlessly transfer files and clipboard text between devices
- No Wi-Fi or internet requiredâ€”works over a direct hotspot connection
- User-selectable sync folder on both desktop and mobile (default: `Downloads/sync-files`)
- Simple setup: scan a QR code to connect and start syncing
- Intuitive, user-friendly interfaces on both platforms
- Secure, local-only communication for privacy
