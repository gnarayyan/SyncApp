# SyncApp: Cross-Platform File & Clipboard Sync

SyncApp enables seamless, secure synchronization of files and clipboard content between your desktop (Windows/Linux/macOS) and mobile device (Android/iOS) **without requiring an internet connection**. The desktop app (Python Tkinter) and mobile app (Flutter) communicate directly over a local hotspot, using QR codes for instant, secure pairing.

## üöÄ Features

- **Effortless File & Clipboard Sync:** Instantly transfer files and clipboard text between devices.
- **No Internet Required:** Works over a direct local hotspot connection.
- **Configurable Sync Folders:** Choose your sync folder on both desktop and mobile (`Downloads/sync-files` by default).
- **Simple Setup:** Scan a QR code to connect and start syncing.
- **User-Friendly Interfaces:** Intuitive UI on both desktop and mobile.
- **Secure, Local-Only Communication:** No data leaves your local network.

## üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Application (Python Tkinter)

- **QR Code Generation:** For secure, instant pairing.
- **Hotspot Server:** Listens for mobile connections on your local network.
- **File Transfer:** Send/receive files with progress tracking.
- **Clipboard Sync:** Automatic, bidirectional clipboard synchronization.
- **Settings:** Configure sync folder, port, and preferences.
- **File Management:** Browse and manage sync folder contents.

## üì± Mobile Application (Flutter)

## üîó How It Works

1. **Desktop** creates a hotspot and starts the server.
2. **Mobile** connects to the hotspot.
3. **Mobile** scans the desktop's QR code to get connection details.
4. **Direct socket connection** is established.
5. **Bidirectional communication** begins for file and clipboard sync.

**Network Architecture:**

- No internet required‚Äîlocal hotspot only.
- Direct TCP socket communication (length-prefixed messages).
- JSON protocol for structured operations.
- QR code contains IP, port, and device info for auto-discovery.
